## Hackerrank Repository

This repository contains sample codewars exercises that I am doing during my training, each problem is order by its skill and category, and the js file contains several ways to solve it. **If you are going through a training using hackerrank, you should try to resolve the problem yourself, before taking a look here.**

Feel free to navigate around, and propose improvements. :)
